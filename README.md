# Introduction

This project analyzes ping pong/tennis table games from the ground up, identifying the table, tracking the ball, and detecting events. This information may be used to referee a ping pong game and develop additional training activities.

The rest of this README explains how to gather and clean data, how to identify tables/balls/events, and how that data is utilized by the referee and training games.
